    "In this GANs section of the Lab, we will use a toy example to help understand the __basic theoretical principles__ behind GANs. The original form of GANs consisted of a __discriminator__ and a __generator__; let's use the analogy of a currency forger and the police. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator is the currency forger, and the output is the counterfeit, for example, a 100-dollar bill. The discriminator is analogous to the police taking the counterfeit and trying to determine if it's real by comparing it to a real $100 bill. In real life, if the counterfeit is easy to detect, the forger will adapt; conversely, the police will also improve; GANs emulate this game of cat and mouse.  \n",

    "\n",
    "What makes GANs interesting is that the __discriminator and generator continuously improve__ each other by a well-formulated cost function that backpropagates the errors. GANs are a family of algorithms that use _learning by comparison_. In the lab, we will review the original formulation and use a simulated dataset. We will also point you to some more advanced methods and issues you will encounter with the real datasets for the next lab. \n"
